# Harry Potter Quiz App

Before I started the CodeClan course, I began learning some android code through the online course Udacity. One of the projects they suggested to create was a quiz app. I decided to base my app on Harry Potter. I created a set number of questions, each with four potential answers. The user is provided with four buttons below the answers which are labelled A, B, C and D. When the user clicks one of the buttons, the app determines if they clicked the correct answer, and adds a point to their total if they answered correctly. The app then disables the buttons for that question so that the user cannot click a second answer. I designed it so that each question appeared one after the other and added a scrolling function so that all the questions can be viewed. After all the questions have been answered, the user's score is shown at the bottom.
